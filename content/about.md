This blog will focus on visualization and interactivity through the combination of R and JavaScript.  All posts will be cross-posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@timelyportfolio) and the [BuildingWidgets](https://buildingwidgets.com/) if you prefer a different reading experience.

For those interested in workflow, the site is built Using RStudio/[Yihui Xie's](https://github.com/yihui) [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package.  The package perfectly illustrates the power of combination blending `R`, `Rmarkdown`, `markdown`, and `Go`.  [Netlify](https://netflify.com) deploys the static site with every push to Github.  Although this might sound difficult to the R user, I promise `blogdown` and Netlify makes all of this straightforward.  Please let me know if I can help.

Thanks so much to [Displayr](https://www.displayr.com/) for sponsoring the first set of posts.
