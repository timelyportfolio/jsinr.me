In this post, we will pivot from iterative tree visualization to using the very popular JavaScript thing called [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) in R.  With some assistance from the helper R package [`reactR`](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/reactR), we will learn to incorporate `React` components in our output and make a [`Semiotic`](https://emeeks.github.io/semiotic/#/semiotic/) chart from R data.  I would recommend reading and working through the [`React` tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) before beginning this post, but I bet you can follow along even if you ignore this recommendation.

## `reactR`

Most `React` projects require at least two things: 

1. `React` and `ReactDOM` JavaScript dependencies
2. [`babel`](https://babeljs.io/) compiler to convert [`JSX`](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and/or ES2015 (and beyond) to plain old JavaScript.

To ease this burden for the R user of `React`, I built the package [`reactR`](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/reactR) which allows us to accomplish both of the above requirements.  `reactR::html_dependency_react()` provides up-to-date JavaScript dependencies for `React` and `ReactDOM` for use in Rmarkdown, Shiny, or other html projects.  `reactR::babel_transform()` uses the `V8` package to compile your `JSX` and ES2015 (and beyond) all within your R session.

### Pattern for React and R

We will use the following generic pattern as we attempt to combine React with R.

```
library(htmltools)
library(reactR)

tagList(
  # add JavaScript dependencies React and ReactDOM
  reactR::html_dependency_react(),
  tags$div(...),
  tags$script(HTML(
    # babel_transform is only necessary if we plan to use
    #   ES2015 and/or JSX.  Most of the React examples out
    #   there will use one or both.
    reactR::babel_transform(
      sprintf(...)
    )
  ))
)
```

## First Example

Let's try it with a real example similar to the `React` [Hello World! example](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).  In our example, we will use `React` to render a heading `h1` along with some text.

```{r}
library(htmltools)
library(reactR)

tagList(
  reactR::html_dependency_react(),
  tags$div(id = "example"),
  tags$script(HTML(
    babel_transform(
"
ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <h1>React + R = BFF</h1>
    <p>This should probably be airbrushed Spring Break style
    on a t-shirt or license plate.
    </p>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById('example')
)
"
    )
  ))
)
```

<div style="background-color:#ccd">
<p style="font-size:0.75em; font-style:italic">Often, quotes " and ' are the most frustrating part about combining JavaScript and R.  I tend to use " for R and ' for JavaScript.</p>
</div>

## Office React Components in R

I know that most R purists have eliminated Microsoft Office from their workflows, but we can bring a little bit of the "good" from Microsoft Office with the very well-built and helpful [`Office UI Fabric`](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric) components for `React`.  And **yes you can use these with Shiny**.

```{r}
library(htmltools)
library(reactR)

fabric <- htmlDependency(
  name = "office-fabric-ui-react",
  version = "5.23.0",
  src = c(href="https://unpkg.com/office-ui-fabric-react/dist"),
  script = "office-ui-fabric-react.js",
  stylesheet = "css/fabric.min.css"
)

browsable(
  tagList(
    html_dependency_react(offline=FALSE),
    fabric,
    tags$div(id="pivot-example"),
    tags$script(HTML(babel_transform(
"
class PivotBasicExample extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Fabric.Pivot>
          <Fabric.PivotItem linkText='My Files'>
            <Fabric.Label>Pivot #1</Fabric.Label>
          </Fabric.PivotItem>
          <Fabric.PivotItem linkText='Recent'>
            <Fabric.Label>Pivot #2</Fabric.Label>
          </Fabric.PivotItem>
          <Fabric.PivotItem linkText='Shared with me'>
            <Fabric.Label>Pivot #3</Fabric.Label>
          </Fabric.PivotItem>
        </Fabric.Pivot>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(<PivotBasicExample />, document.querySelector('#pivot-example'));
"
    )))
  )
)

```

Now you might have noticed that the RStudio Viewer showed up as blank.  This seems to be an issue with non-local JavaScript dependencies in RStudio Viewer.  I think the only way around this problem is to store the dependencies locally.  A package housing these dependencies similar to `reactR` is probably the best option.

## antd React Components to Step Through `lm`

[`antd`](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) is another set of very nice `React` components.  Let's walk through a `lm` from R using the step-through `antd` component.

[![screenshot of antd step through of lm](/images/reactR_example_antd.gif)](https://bl.ocks.org/timelyportfolio/4acc0624527bfc9fa78ce15144b90b21/1cdfc7e0f44a5626b2f2ad25bd3da5b0cf6fb623)

Now we are getting much closer to our ultimate objective of using R data with React with a synergistic result.

## Visualizations with Semiotic

[Elijah Meeks](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks) has very generously contributed the React-based visualization library [`Semiotic`](https://emeeks.github.io/semiotic/#/semiotic/).  We will recreate one of the examples, but we'll do the data part in R.  Data from R and interactive vis from JavaScript hopefully will continue to become a popular and common workflow.

[![screenshot of Semiotic dot plot created from R](/images/reactR_example_semiotic.gif)](http://bl.ocks.org/timelyportfolio/2657963ea577afe43b6eeab798b31c67)

An `htmlwidget` for `Semiotic` would offer the ideal method of full integration, but I have not yet determined a good pattern for creating React-based htmlwidgets.  Please let me know if you have thoughts or would like to collaborate towards achieving this goal.

## Next Steps

An obvious next step would be integrating React with Shiny, and as I said before, this is possible.  Also, there is another very popular JavaScript framework called [`Vue`](https://vuejs.org) that I actually think is even easier to integrate with R.  In the next post, we'll demonstrate R + Vue.
